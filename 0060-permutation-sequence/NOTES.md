n=4 ,k=17
total 24 permutations
starting with 1 -->total 6
starting with 2--> total 6
starting with 3--> total 6
starting with 4--> total 6
// so from this each number is associated with (n-1)! permutations
if k=17 means we have to find 16th premutaion in 0 based indexing  so divide 16/6 which will give 2 means 2nd index which lies in starting with 3
