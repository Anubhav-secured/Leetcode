let say we have original array as=[a,b,c,d]
derived array by definition will be =[a^b,b^c,c^d,d^a] since every element in the derived array is appering twice so if we take xor of all the elements in derived array total xor will be 0
necessary and sufficient condition for the derived array to be valid is xor(derived)=0
xor of derived array is 0 means there will be even no of 1's so sum of array is divisible by 2
